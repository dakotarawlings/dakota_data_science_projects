* Wrote a feed forward neural network model-building library from scratch in C++
* Used pibind11 to build a wrapper for the C++ library to create a python DLL 
* Tested the library by using it to build a model to classify images of handwritten charachters (trained using the MNIST dataset)
* Used the model to build a charachter identifier webapp from scratch in python, flask, javascript, html, and css
* Deployed web app on Heroku: https://char-recognition-cpp.herokuapp.com/
